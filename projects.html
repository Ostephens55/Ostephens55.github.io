      This is a childrens picnic table that I made out of lumber I purchased at
      a local home depot. The table sits two and is recomended for children ages
      5 to 12. The lumber is pressure treated to withstand the elements and has
      an approximate life of 8-10 years. This is a great option for parents who
      are trying to get their kids off of their screens and in the outdoors.

      This is a wooden adirondack chair that I made using a kit I purchased
      online. The kit included all the necessary materials including fasteners
      and was very easy to put together. Adirondack chairs are perfect for all
      outdoor spaces, whether it be a patio, firepit, or simply just out on the
      lawn. They are extremely comfortable and relatively low cost, making them
      perfect for anyone who is looking to spruce up their outdoor living
      spaces.

      This is a custom made firewood shed that I made last summer. It is made
      entirely of wood with a metal tin roof to keep the stored firewood dry and
      out of the elements. The shed also elevates the firewood off the ground to
      prevent rotting and allow airflow for the wood to dry out over time. This
      is a great option for those who have limited indoor storage space but
      enjoy having natural fires.
