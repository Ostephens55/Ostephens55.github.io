      <p>
        Hello, my name is Owen Stephens and I am currently a student-athlete at
        Babson College. I chose to come to Babson for a number of reasons. The
        first being that I am a baseball player and the program here is very
        competitive for the Division III level. The opportunity to continue
        playing at a high level, while also being part of a supportive and
        driven team, was something that really appealed to me. I also chose
        Babson because it is an excellent business school and I knew long before
        I arrived here that I had a keen interest in studying business at the
        university level. Babson’s focus on entrepreneurship and practical
        learning was something that stood out to me, as I wanted to be in an
        environment that would not only challenge me academically but also
        provide real-world applications for the knowledge I would gain. The
        combination of athletics and academics made Babson the ideal place for
        me to grow both personally and professionally.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently in my junior year at Babson, and I have thoroughly
        enjoyed my experience so far, both on the field and in the classroom.
        Over my two and a half years here, I have had the opportunity to grow
        academically, socially, and personally, and through these experiences, I
        have decided to concentrate in Finance. This decision is the first step
        in reaching my goal of working in the wealth management industry, a
        field that excites me due to its potential for making a meaningful
        impact in people’s lives. I believe this industry is a great fit for me
        because it is incredibly client-focused, and I am drawn to the idea of
        building strong, trust-based relationships while helping individuals
        secure their financial futures. The opportunity to work closely with
        clients and guide them toward financial security resonates deeply with
        me, and I’m excited to develop the skills necessary to succeed in this
        dynamic and rewarding field.

      <p>
        I have a number of hobbies outside of Baseball. The first being
        <a href="https://www.pgatour.com/">golf</a>, I enjoy playing golf
        because of the challenging nature of the sport. It is extremely
        difficult to master and there is no better feeling than hitting a ball
        flush. It also allows me to spend quality outdoor time with friends and
        family. Other than golf, my favorite hobby is fishing. It requires a lot
        of patience and time commitment, with most trips resulting in no catch.
        But regardless of our success or lack thereof, I enjoy every minute I
        spend on the water with my friends and family. There is a certain
        element of the ocean that is calming to me, it is truly my happy place.
